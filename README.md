# Cardano Native Token Coin Flip

## Description

This repository offers a comprehensive system that enables users to engage in the classic coinflip game using any native Cardano token. Whether you're testing, simulating, or just playing for fun, this platform provides a seamless experience.

### Information

1) The system administrator is required to create and fund their own Cardano wallet address. The necessary code to do this can be found in the "code" folder.
2) The system administrator is also responsible for providing the tokens that will act as the "Casino Dealer." These tokens will accumulate profits over time. Alternatively, an external provider can maintain these tokens and claim their dealer profits at any time.
3) Access to the coinflip game can be restricted to wallets containing a specific NFT, or it can be made freely accessible to all.
4) The odds for the game can be configured within the scripts.
